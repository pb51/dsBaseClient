\title{ds.asInteger calling assign function asIntegerDS}
\usage{
ds.asInteger(x.name = NULL, newobj = NULL, datasources = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x.name}{the name of the input object to be coerced to class
integer. Must be specified in inverted commas.}

\item{newobj}{the name of the new output variable. If this argument is set
to NULL, the name of the new variable is defaulted to <x.name>.int}

\item{datasources}{specifies the particular opal object(s) to use. If the <datasources>
argument is not specified the default set of opals will be used. The default opals
are called default.opals and the default can be set using the function
{ds.setDefaultOpals}. If an explicit <datasources> argument is to be set,
it should be specified without
inverted commas: e.g. datasources=opals.em or datasources=default.opals. If you wish to
apply the function solely to e.g. the second opal server in a set of three,
the argument can be specified as: e.g. datasources=opals.em[2].
If you wish to specify the first and third opal servers in a set you specify:
e.g. datasources=opals.em[c(1,3)]}
}
\value{
the object specified by the <newobj> argument (or by default <x.name>.int
if the <newobj> argument is NULL) which is written to the serverside.
In addition, two validity messages are returned
indicating whether <newobj> has been created in each data source and if so whether
it is in a valid form. If its form is not valid in at least one study there may
be a studysideMessage that can explain the error in creating
the full output object. As well as appearing on the screen at run time,if you wish to
see the relevant studysideMessages at a later date you can use the {ds.message}
function. If you type ds.message(<newobj>) it will print out the relevant
studysideMessage from any datasource in which there was an error in creating <newobj>
and a studysideMessage was saved. If there was no error and <newobj> was created
without problems no studysideMessage will have been saved and ds.message(<newobj>)
will return the message: "ALL OK: there are no studysideMessage(s) on this datasource".

\description{
This function is based on the native R function \code{as.integer}.
}
\details{
This function is based on the native R function \code{as.integer} (see help file
of function \code{as.integer} in native R). The only difference is that the DataSHIELD 
function first converts the values of the input object into characters and then convert 
those to integers. This addition is important for the case where the input object is of class
factor having integers as levels. In that case, the native R \code{as.integer} function returns
the underlying level codes and not the values as integers. For example \code{as.integer} in R
converts the factor vector:
0 1 1 2 1 0 1 0 2 2 2 1
Levels: 0 1 2
to the following integer vector:
1 2 2 3 2 1 2 1 3 3 3 2
For more information see the warning section in the help file of \code{factor} in native R.
In contrast DataSHIELD converts an inpuct factor with integer levels to its original integer values.
